  abstract = {Data-driven discovery is revolutionizing how we model, predict, and control complex systems. Now with Python and MATLAB{\textregistered}, this textbook trains mathematical scientists and engineers for the next generation of scientific discovery by offering a broad overview of the growing intersection of data-driven methods, machine learning, applied optimization, and classical fields of engineering mathematics and mathematical physics. With a focus on integrating dynamical systems modeling and control with modern methods in applied machine learning, this text includes methods that were chosen for their relevance, simplicity, and generality. Topics range from introductory to research-level material, making it accessible to advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students from the engineering and physical sciences. The second edition features new chapters on reinforcement learning and physics-informed machine learning, significant new sections throughout, and chapter exercises. Online supplementary material - including lecture videos per section, homeworks, data, and code in MATLAB{\textregistered}, Python, Julia, and R - available on databookuw.com.},

  abstract = {This book gives a concise introduction to both image and video processing, providing a balanced coverage between theory, applications and standards. It gives an introduction to both 2-D and 3-D signal processing theory, supported by an introduction to random processes and some essential results from information theory, providing the necessary foundation for a full understanding of the image and video processing concepts that follow. A significant new feature is the explanation of practical network coding methods for image and video transmission. There is also coverage of new approaches such},
